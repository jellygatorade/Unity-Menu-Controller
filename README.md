# UI Menu Controller

Learn how to use a Stack to manage your UI Pages. Create pages that have configurable entry/exit animations, sounds, and actions. This is the base framework I've been using for over 6 years in my own projects and find it to be highly reliable, scalable, and still easy to use.

Actions are a very interesting part because they allow you to prepare pages before they enter, and reset after they have exit, allowing dynamic content to be loaded off-screen and minimizing the number of elements on the Canvas at a time.

Animation Helper provided to allow pages to enter with Slide, Fade, or Zoom animation. More can be added by updating EntryMode enumeration and adding the animation in the AnimationHelper.
